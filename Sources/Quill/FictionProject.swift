        Welcome to your Fiction Project. This note explains how it works and how to make it your own. It's an ordinary file, so delete it whenever you like. You can bring it back any time from the project's ⋯ menu → **Start Here Guide**.

        ## What's in this project

        - **Manuscript** holds your chapters, one file each. It's pinned to the top and colored red because it's where you'll spend most of your time.
        - **Characters**, **Locations**, and **World** hold the people, places, and ideas of your story. Each file can show up as a floating card while you write.
        - **Outline** is for planning: headings become chapters or beats you can see laid out on the **Story Timeline** (File menu). See below.
        - **Notes** is for anything else: research, scraps, loose ideas.
        - **Images** holds the pictures you attach to cards.

        There's also a **Concept.md** file at the top level, pre-filled with a few questions (logline, themes, your own pitch) to help you think the story through before you draft. Delete what you don't need; it's scratch paper.

        Everything here is plain Markdown and ordinary folders. Any other editor can open it, and your cloud service syncs it like any other folder.

        ## Planning with Outline and the Story Timeline

        The **Outline** folder holds plain Markdown files of your own headings — acts, chapters, beats, whatever fits how you plan. Tag any heading with a beat in parentheses and it's placed on the **Story Timeline** (File menu → Story Timeline…, or the toolbar): `(Inciting Incident)`, `(Rising Action)`, `(Midpoint)`, `(Climax)`, `(Falling Action)`, or `(Resolution)`. Untagged headings are spread evenly along the arc, so a rough outline still shows a shape. Click a point on the chart to jump straight to that heading.

        ## Writing the manuscript

        Use the **+** button → **New Chapter**. Sable numbers it for you. Your `#` headings appear in the **Outline** tab, and you can rename that tab to Chapters, Scenes, or anything else from its sliders button. Press ⇧⌘F for paragraph focus, or use the toolbar for reading mode and themes.

        Open the **Manuscript** tab at the top of the desk for your total word count, an optional goal with a progress bar, and every chapter with its length. Drag chapters to rearrange them; the order is saved in the project and your files are never renamed or changed. Other editors will still list them alphabetically.

        ## Cards for characters, places, and ideas

        Use **+** → **New Character** (or Location, or World Note). Each one starts from a template you can rewrite freely. Then hover the file in the desk and click the card icon, or Control-click → **Show as Card**.

        - **Move it.** Drag a card and it snaps to the nearest corner of your page.
        - **Keep or tuck it.** The pin keeps a card open. Unpinned, it shrinks to a small tab and opens when you point at it.
        - **Resize it.** Drag the grip on its outer corner. Double-click the grip to reset.
        - **Add a portrait.** Click the portrait square (or drop an image on the card), then drag and zoom to frame it. **Adjust Crop…** in the card's ⋯ menu changes it later.

        ## Tagging scenes

        In a chapter, a quiet strip of small chips at the bottom of the page shows the location and characters in that scene. Click **Tag this scene** (or press ⌃⌘T) to choose them from your cards. Click a chip to open its card without leaving the page, so you can check a detail and get back to writing. A dashed chip means there's no card with that name yet; click it to create one.

        The strip fades almost away while you type and returns when you pause. In **Writing Style** you can move it to a corner or turn it off. Tags are saved at the top of the chapter's file, so any editor can read them:

        ```
        ---
        location: The Pier
        characters: Marren Vale, Old Tam
        world: Bell Law
        ---
        ```

        A name matches a card by its file name, its title, or a line like `aliases: Mara, The Pilot` in the card. Chips take the card's color, so you can tell people and places apart at a glance. In paragraph focus, the strip and any collapsed card tabs dim until you point at them.

        ## Adding things quickly

        Point at the **Manuscript**, **Characters**, **Locations**, or **World** folder in the desk and click the **+** that appears. Manuscript adds the next chapter; the others ask for a name. It works on folders inside them, too: a **+** on Characters/Villains adds a character there.

        ## What a card reads from the file

        The block at the very top of a card file, between the two `---` lines, holds its details:

        ```
        ---
        type: character
        role: Harbor pilot
        tags: protagonist, pilot
        image: Images/marren.png
        image-crop: 0.10,0.05,0.70,0.88
        color: blue
        ---
        ```

        - **type** says what kind of card it is: `character`, `location`, or `lore` (world notes).
        - **role** (characters), **region** (locations), or **category** (world notes) appears under the name.
        - **tags** appear as small labels. Separate them with commas.
        - **image** and **image-crop** are set for you when you add a portrait.
        - **color** (`red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `gray`, or a hex value like `#8A6A34`) tints the card and its scene-tag chip. Pick one from the card's ⋯ menu → **Color**.

        The card's title is the file's first `# Heading`, and the rest of the file is shown below it.

        ## Making it your own

        - **Add folders.** Make a folder called Factions, Magic, or Timeline. A file becomes a card if it sits in a folder named Characters, Locations, or World, or whenever it has a `type:` line. Put `type: lore` at the top of any file in the project, then Control-click it → **Show as Card**.
        - **Add your own fields.** Write any `key: value` line in the block, like `age: 34` or `home: Saltmarsh`. Sable leaves lines it doesn't use untouched, so they're yours to keep.
        - **Rewrite the templates.** The sections in a new character (Appearance, Personality…) are just Markdown. Delete, rename, or add your own.
        - **Color and pin.** Control-click any file or folder for **Color** and **Pin to Top**. Name your colors (Draft, Revised, Final…) from the sliders button at the top of the file list.
        - **Sort and search.** The sliders button also sets sorting, word counts, and compact rows. The search box searches every folder in the project by name.

        ## Leaving, and changing your mind

        The **Leave** button at the top of the desk takes you back to all your files. To stop treating this folder as a project, use the ⋯ menu → **Convert to Regular Folder…**. That removes only a small hidden file named `.sable-project.json`; every file and folder stays exactly as it is.

        Happy writing.
